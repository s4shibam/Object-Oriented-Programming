# Inheritance in Java

Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).

The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.

Inheritance represents the `IS-A` relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.

Why use inheritance in java?

    - For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).
    - For Code Reusability.
