# Abstract Keyword (abstract)

abstract is a non-access modifier in java applicable for classes, methods but not variables. It is used to achieve abstraction which is one of the pillar of Object Oriented Programming(OOP).

abstract keyword can be used in 2 ways:

    - Abstract classes
    - Abstract methods

### Abstract classes and Abstract methods :

    - An abstract class is a class that is declared with an abstract keyword.

    - An abstract method is a method that is declared without implementation.

    - An abstract class may or may not have all abstract methods. Some of them can be concrete methods

    - A method-defined abstract must always be redefined in the subclass, thus making overriding compulsory or making the subclass itself abstract.

    - Any class that contains one or more abstract methods must also be declared with an abstract keyword.

    - There can be no object of an abstract class. That is, an abstract class can not be directly instantiated with the new operator.

    - An abstract class can have parameterized constructors and the default constructor is always present in an abstract class.
