# Class & Object

### Class:

A `class` is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.

A Class in Java can contain:

    - Fields
    - Methods
    - Constructors
    - Blocks
    - Nested class and interface.

### Object:

An object is an instance of a class. A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. So, an object is the instance (result) of a class.

Object Definitions:

    - An object is a real-world entity.
    - An object is a runtime entity.
    - The object is an entity which has state and behavior.
    - The object is an instance of a class.
