# Encapsulation

Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.
Example: a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.

We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private. Now we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.

The `Java Bean` class is the example of a fully encapsulated class.

### Advantage of Encapsulation in Java

    - Data Hiding: It is a way of restricting the access of our data members by hiding the implementation details. Encapsulation also provides a way for data hiding. The user will have no idea about the inner implementation of the class. It will not be visible to the user how the class is storing values in the variables. The user will only know that we are passing the values to a setter method and variables are getting initialized with that value.

    - Increased Flexibility: We can make the variables of the class read-only or write-only depending on our requirement.

    - Reusability: Encapsulation also improves the re-usability and is easy to change with new requirements.

    - Testing code is easy: Encapsulated code is easy to test for unit testing.
