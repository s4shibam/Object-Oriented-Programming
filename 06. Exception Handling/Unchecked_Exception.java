Unchecked Exceptions

The unchecked exceptions are just opposite to the checked exceptions. The compiler will not check these exceptions at compile time. In simple words, if a program throws an unchecked exception, and even if we didnâ€™t handle or declare it, the program would not give a compilation error.
