# Polymorphism in Java

The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.

### Real-life Illustration of Polymorphism

`A person at the same time can have different characteristics. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee. So the same person possesses different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism.`

Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming. Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations. The word `poly` means many and `morphs` means forms, So it means many forms.

Types of polymorphism

    - Compile-time Polymorphism / Static Polymorphism
        - Method Overloading
        
    - Runtime Polymorphism / Dynamic Polymorphism / Dynamic Method Dispatch
        - Method Overriding
